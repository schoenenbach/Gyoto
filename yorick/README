This is a Yorick plug-in giving access to the Gyoto library. It comes
with a (GTK) graphical interface.

1- Prerequisites (see details below):
_____________________________________

Yorick
______

For direct access to Gyoto, only Yorick is required. Yorick comes
precompiled with many distributions of linux and is present in the
Macports. You can also find binaries and source code at
http://yorick.sourceforge.net/

Yorick >= 2.2 is needed.

For the graphical user interface Gyotoy, you'll need a few additional
pieces. First of all, I seriously doubt it will run under MS Windows,
but please report any news on that front.


Yutils
______

A collection of utilities for Yorick, distributed as yorick-yutils in
many Linux distributions. Actually, only pyk.i is used in Gyotoy (so
far).

Either get yutils > 1.4.0 from e.g. http://www.maumae.net/yorick/packages/src/
or fetch pyk.i from the CVS browser at
http://yorick.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/yorick/yorick-yutils/pyk.i


Yorick-GY
_________

The graphical interface gyotoy needs an additional Yorick plug-in,
plus the Gtk 3 library. Check README.gyotoy.

2- Building
___________

Building the Gyoto plug-in is done the standard way:
./configure
make

You can check the package by running
make check
or by trying out the graphical interface, if you have installed all
the dependencies:
./gyotoy.i

3- Installing
_____________

make install


4- Running
__________

Read gyoto.i and check.i for using Gyoto from within Yorick.

The graphical interface, Gyotoy, can be run with
yorick -i gyotoy.i

If everything goes well,
./gyotoy
should do, too.
