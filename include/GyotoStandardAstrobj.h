/**
 * \class Gyoto::Astrobj::Standard
 * \brief Astronomical objects defined bya a potential/distance
 *
 *  Many geometrically thick objects can be defined by the value of a
 *  function of the 4 coordinates, and their emission can often be
 *  defined in terms of an emission law and of a transmission law.
 *
 *  This is a base class for this standard case which simplifies a lot
 *  writting new Astrobjs.
 *
 *  It is either to implement a sub-class of Astrobj::Standard than a
 *  sub-class of Astrobj::Generic. In particular, there is no need to
 *  implement the Generic::Impact() function. Instead, one needs to
 *  implement a few much simpler functions and most of the complex
 *  ray-tracing algorithms and heuristics is implemented in
 *  Standard::Impact(). It is recommended to read first the
 *  introduction in the Gyoto::Astrobj namespace documentation.
 *
 *  The geometrical shape of a Gyoto::Astrobj::Standard object is
 *  yielded by a function of the 4 position vector. This function is
 *  implemented as operator()(). The velocity field of the fluid is
 *  implemented in the getVelocity() method. The emission(),
 *  integrateEmission() and transmission() methods implement the
 *  radiative transfer primitives for this object. Finally, you may
 *  choose to reimplement processHitQuantities() and Impact(), but
 *  this should not be necessary (that is the all point of the
 *  Standard class).
 *
 * Like any other Astrobj::Generic sub-classes, an Astrobj::Standard
 * subclass should register an Astrobj::Subcontractor_t function using
 * the Astrobj::Register() function. See also \ref
 * writing_plugins_page .
