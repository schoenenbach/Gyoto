This version includes modifications in the Metric to describe
a modified Kerr metric. See

       General relativitY Orbit Tracer of Observatoire de Paris

Gyoto aims at providing a framework for computing orbits and
ray-traced images in General relativity. It consists in a library
(libgyoto), utility programs, and a plug-in for the Yorick programing
language.

We request that use of Gyoto in scientific publications be properly
acknowledged. Please cite:

    Gravity 28, 225011 (2011) [arXiv:1109.4769]

We also request that Gyoto modifications, extensions or plug-ins
leading to a scientific publication be made public as free software
reasonably fast (within one year after publication of the scientific
paper), for instance by contributing it directly to the Gyoto
code base. Contributors will be listed in the relevant source files as
well as in the AUTHORS file in the package.

Refer to the file INSTALL for building and installing Gyoto.
Specific instructions for Linux/Ubuntu are in the file INSTALL.ubuntu. 

Several sample files are provided in doc/examples. You can ray-trace
those sceneries with:

  gyoto <input-file.xml> <output-file.fits>

FITS files can be read by a variety of free and proprietary
software. See http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html.

Custom metrics and astronomical objects can be added fairly easily by
implementing them as a Gyoto plug-in. This, of course, requires
knowledge of the C++ language. We don't provide yet a complete guide,
but look at the standard plug-in lib/StdPlug.C which includes the Kerr
metric and the standard objects. The Lorene (numerical) metrics are
also implemented as a plug-in, see lib/LorenePlug.C and
lib/Makefile.lorene.
